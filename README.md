OpenAI Assistant Manager by GKMWD

This Python script was developed to facilitate the creation, management and interaction with OpenAI assistants using the OpenAI API. It allows you to create assistants, start conversations, send messages and submit tool outputs to assistants, all programmatically.

Prerequisites

•	 Python 3.x

•	 Openai library (installable via pip install openai)

Configuration

Before running the script, it is necessary to configure some variables in the code:

1.	 Wizard data: Fill in the assistants_data list with the details of each wizard you want to create. Be sure to include the name, instructions, model, tools and any other data needed for each wizard.

2.	 Message data: Fill in the messages_data list with the details of each message you want to send to the assistants. Be sure to include the thread ID, the role of the sender (user or wizard), the content of the message and the IDs of the files, if applicable.

3.	 Tool output data: Fill in the tool_outputs_data list with the details of each tool output you want to submit to the wizards. Be sure to include the thread ID, the execution ID, the tool call ID and the corresponding output.

Use

After configuring the necessary data, just run the Python script. It will create the wizards, start conversations, send messages and submit tool outputs as specified in the data provided.

Notes

•	 Make sure you have a valid OpenAI account with the necessary permissions to create and interact with assistants.

•	 This script is a basic example and can be extended or customized as needed to meet the specific requirements of the project.
